TODO:
- Static build of routed components:
  - create lazy-module wrapper for each library
  - update app-routes
  - add menuitem registration
- Investigate the option of a better extension format:
  - app (federated-module)
  - lib (library which lets the extension to be built statically)
- More meaningful components for demoing:
  - content list
  - process list
  - etc
- User avatar
- Better template design
