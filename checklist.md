TODO:
- Investigate the option of a better extension format and create a builder and packager for it:
  - app (federated-module)
  - lib (library which lets the extension to be built statically)
- Test the static build with multiple extensions, not just with one
- More meaningful components for demoing:
  - content list
  - process list
  - etc
- User avatar
- Better template design
